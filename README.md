# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'm doing something slightly different, and challnging myself to do a new language each day. Spinning a Wheel to make the choice for me.

The languages on the wheel are:

- Go
- Rust
- Typescript
- Ruby
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Java
- Zig
- Python
- C#
- C++
- C

## Day 1 ⭐⭐

Day 1's language is Elixir, and [can be found here](elixir/day1)

## Day 2 ⭐⭐

Day 2's language is Zig. Or at least, it should have been. I was able to solve the problem in tests, but could not get the data file to load. I'll come back to this at a later date. In the end, to solve the problem [I wrote it in typescript](typescript/day2/).
