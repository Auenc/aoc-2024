# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'm doing something slightly different, and challnging myself to do a new language each day. Spinning a Wheel to make the choice for me.

The languages on the wheel are:

- Go
- Rust
- Typescript
- Ruby
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python
- C#
- C++
- C

## Day 1 ‚≠ê

Day 1's language is Elixir, and [can be found here](elixir/day1)
